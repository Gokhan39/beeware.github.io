There are many ways to help with BeeWare.

`First-time Contributors`_
---------------------------

If you're new to the project (or even entirely new to open source in general), the best place to start is `here </contributing/how/first-time/>`__. Everyone can contribute to open source, and we're here to show you how.

.. _First-time Contributors: /contributing/how/first-time/

Code Contributions
-------------------

Your code contributions are welcome! Please familiarize yourself with
our `Development Process </contributing/how/process/>`__.

If you're looking for something to work on, and don't know where your
effort would be welcome, try looking at the ticket tracker for a project
of interest. There will usually be a couple of tickets with known
problems; any ticket is a candidate for being fixed.

If you're a first time contributor, some tickets are also tagged as
`[good first issue] <https://github.com/search?q=user%3Abeeware+label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen&type=issues>`__.
These are special issues that have been selected because they're
relatively simple introductions to the project, and the BeeWare team
will mentor any first time contributor in committing a patch for
one of these issues.

Platform Usage
---------------

Do you use Windows or various flavours of Linux? Are you able to install a project or application on your system? Did you run into any problems?

If so, please update the documentation to show how you were able to get it to work, or log an issue if you've found a bug that you can't fix.

Documentation
--------------

Is the documentation up to date? Do you think things could be worded differently? Are there missing sections? Do you have an idea for a tutorial that could be written? Please submit a Pull Request!

Help translate and update this Website
---------------------------------------

Is there anything wrong or missing from this website? Please feel free to `make edits <https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io>`__ and submit a pull request!

Want to help translate or update the content of this website? Visit the `translations section </contributing/how/translations>`__.


Build a real application!
--------------------------

Ultimately BeeWare is a set of tools for building applications. One of the best
ways to evaluate our progress is to see people build real-world applications
with the BeeWare tools. So if you've got an idea for an application you've
always wanted or needed - try to build it!

In the process of building that application, you'll likely find bugs, missing
features, or friction in the development process. Those problems can then be
turned into bug reports or patches.

Something else
---------------

If you've got your own idea for something, or if you don't see any
tickets, or you want to be mentored on a ticket, or you aren't sure how
to proceed, contact the project maintainers on
`Mastodon <https://fosstodon.org/@beeware>`__ or
`Discord </bee/chat/>`__. The project maintainers love
collaborating, especially with new contributors, and will gladly answer
any questions or walk you through any problems you may encounter.

All Contributions Welcome
----------------------------------

But it's not just about code. A successful software project requires documentation, design skills, feedback and bug reports. The BeeWare community acknowledges that all contributions are important - not just the ones that come as a pull request on GitHub.
